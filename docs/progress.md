# Progress

One entry per slice: what shipped, the check commands with exit codes, and what is mocked.

## Slice 1 — Docs

Shipped: `docs/product.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/decisions.md` (ADR-000 to ADR-018,
provider choice, open questions), `docs/pricing.md` (formula, config v1, three worked
examples, estimator), `docs/security.md`, `docs/risks.md`, `LICENSE-AUDIT.md`.

Checks: no code yet; lint, typecheck, and test commands arrive with slice 2.

Verified before writing (2026-10-28): partforge 0.166.0 builds, verifies, and exports
STL/3MF (Manifold) and STEP (OCCT) headlessly on Node 22; Meshy docs read for ADR-006.
